Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, persuaded by the Clinton administration peace team to pay a groundbreaking visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum next week, angrily canceled the plan after museum officials rebuffed his overture.	LEAD
Conceived as a gesture of reconciliation by U.S. deputy special Mideast envoy Aaron Miller, Arafat's visit would have been the first to the exhibition on Nazi genocide by a major Arab leader and a highly symbolic acknowledgment of the defining event of the century for many Jews.	MAIN
By the time plans for the visit had fallen apart yesterday, the episode had become the latest irritant in the faltering talks between Israel and the Palestinians.	MAIN
Arafat is coming to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Clinton, who will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu next week in an effort to inject new urgency into their stalled negotiations.	MAIN
Miller and his superior, Dennis Ross, both of whom serve on the panel that functions as the Holocaust museum's board of directors, suggested the visit to Arafat through intermediaries after believing they had won the consent of Miles Lerman, a death camp survivor who chairs the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.	CIRC
But museum sources said members of the American Jewish community warned Lerman and museum Director Walter Reich that "this [Arafat] is Hitler incarnate," as one official put it, and must not be welcomed in the memorial to Hitler's victims.	CIRC
When Lerman and Reich informed Arafat he could visit the museum only as an individual, without the special measures for security and protocol routinely accorded world leaders, Arafat struck the visit from his schedule.	CIRC
Lerman, reached at his New Jersey home, said the subject of Arafat and Israel's talks with the Palestinian Authority still profoundly divided U.S. and world Jewry and "we believe the museum should not get involved in a political dispute where half of the people are for something and half are against it.	VERB
If and when the day will come when peace will be established between the state of Israel and the Palestinians then we will be more than happy to receive Arafat as a leader and celebrate that achievement," Lerman said.	VERB
Among Arafat's advisers, ever sensitive to loss of face, a tightly restrained sense of grievance prevailed yesterday.	CONS
We didn't create this idea," Nabil Abu Irdineh, who notified Arafat of the snub late Thursday night, said in a telephone interview from the West Bank city of Nablus.	VERB
He said yes.	VERB
They are saying no.	VERB
It's as simple as that.	VERB
We have been extending our hands since the days of [Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin, and our hands are still slapped.	VERB
Somebody is still living in the past.	VERB
Lerman and museum spokeswoman Mary Morrison emphasized that the federally funded memorial cannot lawfully turn away any individual and would make no attempt to do so if Arafat simply turned up at the popular tourist draw.	CIRC
The doors are open from 10 in the morning to 5:30 in the afternoon," Lerman said.	VERB
But Lerman also added that the museum would not extend Arafat the formal courtesies that are routine for other world leaders, and museum officials said they well understood that withholding special coordination effectively rendered the visit impossible.	CONS
You're obviously not going to have Yasser Arafat standing in line to get a pass," one official said.	VERB
Arafat and his aides had approached the visit gingerly, according to several people directly involved in the plans.	CIRC
Competing self-images of victimhood have long prevented Israelis and Arabs from acknowledging the full weight of each other's historical tragedies, and many Arab leaders have resisted efforts to lure them to the museum and the similar Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem.	CIRC
Miller and Ross felt strongly, according to officials familiar with their views, that a quiet visit to the memorial could mark a psychological breakthrough for skeptical Jews and help Arafat understand the fears of an adversary he has experienced primarily as a regional superpower.	CIRC
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, her spokesman James P. Rubin said in an interview yesterday, routinely encourages world leaders to visit the memorial but "with regard to Chairman Arafat, it is particularly important that he visit because the horrors of the Holocaust were a defining event in Jewish history.	VERB
Among those who helped overcome the Palestinian leader's initial concerns were former congressman Wayne Owens, who heads the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation.	VERB
Owens participated in a conference call last week with Mohammed Rasheed, a key aide to Arafat, and sent a memo, he said, arguing that "it would be a nice symbolic thing for him to do, an appropriate gesture.	VERB
Hani Masri, a Palestinian American businessman who often represents Arafat informally in Washington, said he told Arafat all the arguments of Miller and Ross "and Arafat said fine.	VERB
I thought we should concentrate on positive things," Masri said, "and having him be the first Arab leader to visit the museum would bring our communities together.	VERB
But Thursday night, Lerman told Masri that the museum would not cooperate.	CIRC
Hani called me at home, he's almost crying," said another former official who played an intermediary role.	VERB
An Arab diplomat in Washington familiar with the episode, said, "It shows that some people have not got over their complexes yet.	VERB
Associates of Arafat described him as furious.	VERB
Lerman, for his part, said he intended no slight.	CIRC
I would be heartbroken if the peace process fell apart," he said, emphasizing that he spoke for himself and not the museum.	VERB
Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people, and I believe he is trying his best.	VERB

In a driving hail storm, a small knot of rowdy Palestinian teenagers demonstrated their support for Iraq and President Saddam Hussein today in the time-honored way -- by holding a lighter to an American flag.	LEAD
No go; the flag was soaked.	LEAD
So, with television cameras rolling and everyone dripping wet, they resorted to tearing the flag to pieces.	LEAD
It was a soggy reenactment of the larger and more passionate pro-Iraqi demonstrations of 1991, when Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat openly sided with Saddam Hussein during the Persian Gulf War and thousands of Palestinians cheered.	HIST
The fallout from Iraq's defeat in that war took its toll on Palestinians economically and politically.	MAIN
Today, as another showdown in the Persian Gulf looms, many Palestinians still support Saddam Hussein.	MAIN
But this time, their leaders mostly are keeping their heads down.	MAIN
The Palestinian leadership's muted response to the latest gulf crisis reflects a new political reality.	HIST
The 1991 war came in the midst of the intifada, the six-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.	HIST
Most Palestinians perceived the United States as their enemy, and Saddam Hussein was revered as an Arab leader with the guts to take on Washington.	HIST
Today, four years after Arafat and the late Israeli leader, Yitzhak Rabin, launched a peace process under U.S. auspices, Palestinians have too much to lose by being seen to embrace the Iraqi president.	EVAL
Although negotiations have been stalled for nearly a year, the Palestinians are aware that only Washington has the clout to get the peace process moving again.	EVAL
In recent days, as small street rallies in Gaza and the West Bank have captured air time on the evening news, Arafat and his lieutenants have been all but invisible.	MAIN
When they do make an appearance, it is generally to express blandly their support for the Iraqi people and their hopes for a diplomatic solution and to complain that Washington is treating Baghdad unfairly.	MAIN
Generally, Saddam Hussein's name does not pass their lips.	MAIN
Although Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO is organizing some of the street protests, Fatah officials have explained almost apologetically that they are merely a way for Palestinians to let off steam.	CIRC
The rallies are a way for Palestinians "to let out their frustrations" over the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a perceived U.S. double standard in dealing with Israel and the Arabs, Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah leader, told the Associated Press.	CIRC
In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem, 14 Palestinians were injured Saturday when Israeli troops fired rubber-coated metal bullets at a few hundred demonstrators who attacked them with stones.	CIRC
Today, in the northern West Bank town of Jenin, between 1,000 and 2,000 demonstrators carried posters of Saddam Hussein and Arafat.	CIRC
Death to Clinton and Blair," read one banner, referring to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has supported President Clinton's Iraqi policy.	CIRC
And here in Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, about 150 marchers burned U.S., Israeli and British flags and chanted, "With our blood and soul, we will redeem you, Saddam.	CIRC
Demonstrators eluded Palestinian police to throw stones at Israeli troops, who fired rubber-coated bullets to disperse them.	CIRC
Although small, the rallies show that Saddam Hussein continues to exercise a hold on the imagination of many Palestinians.	EVAL
In a culture defined by the conviction that it has been victimized by Israel, many people identify with the Iraqi leader as another Arab unjustly abused.	EVAL
If Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, say many Palestinians, well, so does Israel.	EVAL
He's defending himself just as we are; he's not doing anything wrong," said Ramzi Hussein of Ramallah, an aspiring violist in his late teens who wears his hair high and tight and his politics on his sleeve.	VERB
It's his country.	VERB
He can do whatever he wants.	VERB
Other Palestinians said they had no special regard for Saddam Hussein, but nonetheless resented what they regard as Washington's war-mongering.	VERB
I don't care if they want to take Saddam out of power, but if you look at it from a humanitarian point of view, people are starving" in Iraq, said a Palestinian who gave his name only as Rob, a thirtyish computer engineer who lives in Arizona and returned to Ramallah to visit.	VERB
Many Palestinians are aware that the current crisis will do nothing to advance the peace process or their aspirations for greater autonomy.	EVAL
First, Clinton's political crisis in Washington seemed to neutralize his attempts to unblock the stalemated negotiations; now, with the administration's gaze focused on Iraq, the problems of the West Bank will have to wait even longer.	EVAL
Today, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators headed to Washington for the latest round of peace talks, but given events in the Persian Gulf, little progress was expected by either side.	CONS
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has used the Palestinians' lingering pro-Iraq sentiment to attack them in the media.	VERB
It brings back unpleasant memories, and it shows the need for real acceptance of Israel; that has not sunk in," he said today.	VERB

Government antitrust officials are taking aim at Rupert Murdoch's latest highflying venture.	LEAD
After almost eight months of investigation, the Justice Department is preparing to challenge a plan by Murdoch's News Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. to merge their U.S. satellite TV operations with Primestar Partners, the nation's second-largest satellite TV company, sources familiar with the inquiry say.	MAIN
The department's telecommunications staff will recommend soon that the merger be blocked outright or substantially modified, according to these sources.	MAIN
Although such a recommendation doesn't guarantee that the government will sue to stop Murdoch-MCI and Primestar, it reflects deep-seated concerns by staff experts about the pending $ 1.1 billion deal.	EVAL
The staff would like to stop this," said a source, who asked not to be identified.	VERB
It'll be a lot tougher to explain a decision not to do something than a decision to challenge it.	VERB
As Primestar is partly owned by four large cable TV companies, Justice officials are worried that Primestar will use the powerful Murdoch-MCI satellite operations to harm competing satellite TV companies and preserve the cable industry's market dominance.	CIRC
District-based MCI and News Corp., through a joint venture called American Sky Broadcasting, own a choice orbital "slot," essentially a parking space in outer space.	CIRC
MCI bought the slot for $ 682.5 million at a government auction in 1996.	CIRC
The slot is highly valuable because it is one of only three available in this country from which a satellite can beam TV programs across most of North America simultaneously.	CIRC
The other two slots are being used by Primestar's competitors, DirecTV Inc. and Echostar Communications Corp.	CIRC
American Sky Broadcasting agreed in June to transfer its slot to Primestar for $ 1.1 billion in preferred, nonvoting stock.	PREV
The Justice Department's lengthy review of the deal is already threatening to scuttle Primestar's plans to launch a satellite this summer.	CIRC
The company has been hoping to use the satellite and the MCI-News Corp. slot to enable its subscribers to begin using 18-inch receiving dishes.	CIRC
Primestar customers now use dishes that are 33 to 36 inches wide.	CIRC
The company believes moving to the smaller dish, now used by DirecTV and Echostar's Dish Network, will allow it to gain more subscribers in urban and suburban areas where larger dishes are impractical.	EVAL
It is important for Primestar to get this issue resolved soon," said Daniel J. O'Brien, Primestar's president, in a statement.	VERB
We'll continue to work to provide the government with the information they need to render a decision, and we're still hopeful for a positive outcome," O'Brien said.	VERB
A long list of opponents to the deal has emerged, including DirecTV, Echostar, small cable operators, companies that use microwaves to send TV signals to subscribers and regional phone companies Bell South Corp. and Ameritech Corp., which are trying to enter the cable business.	CIRC
Critics argue that Primestar could potentially hurt them in one of two key ways: by withholding popular cable programming the Primestar partners own, or by marketing "bundled" cable and satellite TV service at a price that would substantially undersell competitors.	VERB
Sources close to Primestar say these concerns are misplaced, and safeguards could easily be put in place even if there was a potential harm.	VERB
Blocking the deal, they argue, would ultimately harm consumers by denying them services Primestar could provide, and would place the valuable Murdoch-MCI satellite slot in limbo.	VERB
The Federal Communications Commission is conducting a separate review of the Primestar-Murdoch-MCI combination, and is likely to rule on it next month.	EXPE
The FCC must determine whether the deal is in "the public interest," a somewhat hazily defined standard that gives the agency wide discretion.	EXPE
Primestar's largest shareholder is TCI Satellite Entertainment, a publicly traded spinoff of cable giant	CIRC
Tele-Communications Inc. Other cable industry owners include Time Warner Inc., MediaOne, Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.	CIRC

BEIJING,	LEAD
June 29-	LEAD
China trumpeted $ 2 billion worth of deals signed with U.S. companies today at the Great Hall of the People to mark President Clinton's visit, but many of them had been agreed to long before Clinton's arrival in China.	LEAD
Contracts worth another $ 1.1 billion were signed with U.S. companies last week before Clinton's arrival, the official Chinese news agency said.	PREV
A huge component of the total -- China's purchase of 16 Boeing 737 passenger planes and a 747 jumbo jet -- was agreed to last year.	PREV
The 17 aircraft, worth $ 800 million, were among a fleet of 50 that China agreed to buy during President Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit last October.	PREV
Boeing said today, however, that a new letter of intent was signed to sell 10 additional 737s worth $ 400 million.	PREV
Clinton did not attend the signings; administration officials said that was to avoid any suggestion that American policy might be connected to the sale of American products.	VERB
China's is promoting the total figure apparently in hopes of defusing American frustration over the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit $ 50 billion in 1997.	CIRC
At an American Chamber of Commerce dinner here Sunday night, administration officials and members of Congress warned that the huge deficit is politically "unsustainable.	CIRC
The contracts signed here would make only a small dent in the trade deficit.	CIRC
China sought to highlight several purchases of American goods, nonetheless.	MAIN

The Chindex deal is the first Chinese-American joint venture in hospitals and today marked the formal opening of the facility, although it started treating patients some months ago.	VERB
It will serve as a model for China's developing health-care system, and it will serve as a showcase for American high-tech medical equipment and American-style patient-centered care," Daley said.	VERB
Chindex will import equipment including Acuson color Doppler ultrasound scanners; Lunar bone densitometers; PLC Medical Systems lasers used for heart surgery; Trex Medical/XRE Division cardiac-intervention imaging systems; and Johnson & Johnson ortho-diagnostic clinical laboratory equipment.

It was a sunny afternoon of chants, prayers and celebrity-gawking.	MAIN
Speeches from exiled Tibetan leaders, activists and members of Congress were interspersed with musical acts.	MAIN
Speakers representing a wide political spectrum called upon the president to keep human rights in Tibet a priority as he meets with Chinese government officials later this month and to pressure the Chinese to open negotiations with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader.	MAIN
If Israel can meet with Palestine and Britain can meet with [Irish nationalist] Gerry Adams, why can't China meet with the Dalai Lama?" asked John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign to Free Tibet.	VERB

I haven't see a movement of college-age kids and older [people] since my days in college.	VERB
Then it was about the Vietnam War," said actor Richard Gere, a longtime activist on Tibet.	VERB
Speakers delineated a variety of human rights abuses occurring in Tibet under the Chinese government, including the torture of political prisoners, forced sterilization and abortions and religious and cultural oppression.	MAIN
One major concern of activists is the whereabouts of the Panchan Lama, a 9-year-old considered to be the youngest political prisoner in the world.	MAIN
The Panchan Lama disappeared in May 1995 with his parents.	MAIN

Hundreds of Nigerians held scattered protests today in Lagos to demand an end to military rule, but troops and police dispersed them with tear gas and warning shots, witnesses and news reports said.	MAIN
The Lagos-based leadership of Nigeria's democracy movement had called for demonstrations today to press Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, to quickly end Nigeria's 15 straight years of military rule by handing power to a transitional government under jailed politician Moshood Abiola.	MAIN
The protest marked the fifth anniversary of Abiola's apparent victory in a presidential election that was subsequently scuttled by the military.	EVAL
But relatively few Nigerians responded to the call, underscoring that, while the military government is deeply unpopular, few Nigerians are ready to actively confront it.	EVAL
Democracy activists said protests were held today outside Lagos, but there was no independent report of them.	CIRC
Many Nigerians are consumed by their daily struggle for survival amid the country's economic collapse.	EVAL
And some activists and Nigerian journalists have said many people want to give Abubakar more time to respond to the popular demand for civilian rule.	EVAL
Abubakar was named head of state Monday night after his predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, died, reportedly of a heart attack.	CIRC
Abacha had promised a handover to civilian rule but maneuvered himself into position as the only legal candidate in presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 1.	CIRC
Nigerians have overwhelmingly rejected the Abacha transition plan, but Abubakar, upon taking power, declared he would complete it.	PREV
The democracy movement contends that the Abacha process can only be a front for continued military rule.	PREV
The government had banned today's protests, and police and troops heavily deployed forces around Lagos to prevent them.	CIRC
At a square in the Yaba district, an estimated 200 people, mostly young men, gathered.	MAIN
Many carried anti-government placards and leaflets, according to news agencies and Nigerian journalists.	MAIN
As pro-democracy leaders headed by human rights lawyer Gani Fawehinmi arrived to begin a rally, police swept into the square, firing tear gas canisters and warning shots into the air.	MAIN
No deaths or injuries were immediately reported.	MAIN
People fled, and Fawehinmi collapsed from the tear gas and was taken away by police.	CONS
His spokesman in the United States, Lanre Banjo, said tonight that police had charged Fawehinmi with inciting the public against the government and had released him after a few hours.	CONS
In all, Banjo said, the protest's organizing group, the Joint Action Committee of Nigeria, was aware of about 40 people who had been arrested.	CONS
Police also took to the streets in Ibadan, but the city, Nigeria's second-largest, remained calm, the BBC reported.	CONS
Anti-government riots in Ibadan left seven dead last month.	CONS
Lagos and Ibadan are the main cities of Nigeria's ethnic Yorubas, who are the country's most alienated group.	CIRC
Yorubas say they are denied a fair share of political power by northern ethnic groups -- including Hausas and Fulanis -- that have dominated the military and the government since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960.	CIRC
Today's protest underscored that Nigeria has suffered more or less continual crisis and confrontation for five years.	EVAL
In 1993, the northern-dominated government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, having promised a return to civilian rule, held elections on June 12 for a civilian president.	PREV
But when the vote count showed Abiola, a southern Yoruba, crushing his northern, Hausa-speaking opponent, Bashir Tofa, the government canceled the vote, throwing the country into an uproar.	PREV
Babangida soon surrendered power to a military-backed civilian interim government, which Abacha pushed aside after three months.	PREV
A year later, he jailed Abiola for insisting on his claim to power, and protests have continued sporadically since then.	PREV

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)	LEAD
An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed work in Iraq Friday, nearly two months after his team was effectively blocked.	LEAD
Scott Ritter led his team on a 10-hour tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as ``sensitive'' by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said.	MAIN
``All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities,'' Dacey said.	VERB
At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press.	VERB
Previously the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such quarters.	VERB
The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.	CIRC
It was the first time that Ritter, who arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over a week, had been allowed to carry out an inspection since Jan. 13.	CIRC
Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter's team with escorts, making it impossible for him to enter any site.	PREV
Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons.	PREV
The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the daily tally of inspections, did not mention Ritter by name, but said Friday that team no.	MAIN
225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance.	MAIN
Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites, the agency reported.	MAIN
An Iraqi official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors.	VERB
The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by the Feb. 23 accord signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.	CIRC
Ritter's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement, under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces.	EVAL
The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Iraq unless it gave the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam's palaces.	VERB
Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty.	VERB
A Pentagon spokesman said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections.	VERB
``We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future,'' said spokesman Kenneth Bacon.	VERB
The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq.	PREV

These days, however, their employers - hotel and resort operators - are finding it increasingly difficult to stretch those facial muscles.	LEAD
After many years of strong growth, local hoteliers are now treading the downward trajectory of their cyclical industry, and with rock bottom still far ahead, there's more reason to be glum than smiling.	MAIN

After all, it had continuously attracted ever more business and holiday travellers.	CIRC
But even as new hotels were rapidly springing up, warning bells were set off as early as 1995.	HIST
New hotel rooms coming onstream in most parts of Malaysia far outstripped the increase in tourist arrivals, and occupancy levels and room rates in most states had begun to fall by the end of 1996.	HIST

Thanks to the haze, tourist arrivals in 1997 were almost 17% lower than the year before, the first time in decades there had been a drop in the number of arrivals to Malaysia.	EVAL
Analysts tracking the hotel sector said occupancy levels in 1997 fell 5- 10% from 1996's figures, partly due to the bad publicity Malaysia received during the year, and partly because there were lots more rooms on the market.	VERB

This would more than double the existing stock of three, four- and five-star hotel rooms in Malaysia.	EXPE
In Kuala Lumpur alone, some 13,161 hotel rooms were under construction in 1997, with another 18,165 rooms in the pipeline (though no doubt some projects have been dropped because of the economic slowdown).	CIRC
For comparison, the city at the time had barely 17,000 rooms.	CIRC
Selangor, meanwhile, is expected to have more than 10,000 hotel rooms by the time the Commonwealth Games take place, about twice the existing supply of 5,640 rooms.	CIRC
The Ministry of Finance's 1997 Property Market report says the situation is pretty much the same in most of the other states.	CIRC
`The signs were already there, this overbuilding.	VERB
Even in 1995 the signs were there,' a puzzled Low Gee Tat, managing director of Federal Hotels International, told Investors Digest.	VERB
`We were already feeling the pinch then.	VERB
Although occupancy was still OK, the rates stank.	VERB
The sheer difficulty in operating just eroded into our bottom line.	VERB
It was difficult to get staff, competition was intense - it was a very difficult situation to operate in.	VERB
`Somehow, somewhere, the developers that went into the business in recent years read the wrong signals or got the wrong advice or whatever, because the signs were definitely there.	VERB
There's really a big glut in this country, a huge glut.'	VERB
Federal Hotels International (FHI) is the hotel arm of the Low Yat group, one of Malaysia's largest property developers.	VERB
They were the first to build and operate an international class hotel in Malaysia - The Federal Kuala Lumpur - in 1957.	VERB
Today, FHI has a chain of four- and five-star hotels, five of which are run jointly with Inter-Continental Hotels &AMP; Resorts.	CIRC
Inked on November 1996, the `strategic alliance' gave birth to Federal Inter-Continental Hotels and Resorts Malaysia, of which Low is the chairman.	CIRC
The hotels in FHI's line-up, besides The Federal, are The Capitol Kuala Lumpur, Crown Princess Inter-Continental Kuala Lumpur, Forum Fairlane Hotel Kuala Lumpur, the Ferringhi Beach Hotel Penang, and the Marina Mirage	CIRC
Inter-	CIRC
Continental Penang (opening soon).	CIRC
Overseas, FHI owns the Forum	CIRC
The Grace Hotel Sydney and Rushcutters Bay Sydney (opening 1999), in Australia.	CIRC
Low explained that with occupancy levels falling because rooms outnumbered tourists, hoteliers came under pressure to lower room rates.	CIRC
But four- and five-star hotels in Malaysia were always among the cheapest in the world, if not the cheapest, he said.	VERB
`For the service and quality you get, room rates have never been on the high side.'	VERB
Operating costs on the other hand were soaring.	VERB
Trouble was indeed brewing (see story on hotel stocks).	VERB
Then came the haze in the later half of 1977, which forced hoteliers to drastically lower their already low rates just to fill some rooms.	VERB
As a result profit margins and yields were eroded further, and the books of many hotel operators blushed scarlet.	VERB
`It was an undeclared price war,' Low admitted, `but that is an ugly word.	VERB
After that knock by the haze, a lot of hotels had to do it out of necessity.	VERB
They had to survive.	VERB
They didn't do it to increase market share or as strategy - it was like scraping the barrel just to get some occupancy.'	VERB
Things haven't improved much this year.	VERB
The first quarter has traditionally been slow for city-based hotels, but this year `it's been slower than normal,' noted Low.	VERB
`The ideal situation for January to March in a decent year is an occupancy rate of 70-75% with good (room) rates, but so far this year the average occupancy has been between 50 and 55% and room rates have also come down.'	VERB
FHI had foreseen a few years ago that the future would be tougher, and had implemented counteracting strategies, he said.	VERB
Nevertheless, FHI's bottomline has not escaped unscathed.	VERB
`There's no way we can operate a hotel the way we did even five years ago,' said Low.	VERB
`We had to become more efficient, more productive and more innovative.	VERB
We've done that and we are still doing that.	VERB
We've had to change the cost structure and we are changing the manning structure.	VERB
`From these basic infrastructural changes, we got into a position to really look at our products and to know our market.	VERB
If we had to, we changed our products to suit the market.'	VERB
Once the products (hotel rooms and special packages) had been fine- tuned, FHI focused on the domestic market and went all out to retain the customers it had by making it `even more value-for-money for them, to give them even more reason to stay with us.'	VERB
At the same time, FHI aggressively tried to tap new overseas markets, especially in East Europe and the United States.	VERB
Low said the group already had a representative office in Europe which not only pushed FHI's hotels but also promoted Malaysia as a holiday and business destination.	VERB
`There must be a reason for them to come here in the first place,' he pointed out.	VERB
Some analysts predict it would take at least until the end of 1999 before visitor arrivals grow large enough to start pushing up occupancy levels nationwide.	VERB
The estimate, however, assumes that the haze doesn't become an annual blight.	VERB
But behind every dark cloud is a silver lining.	EXPE
It seems ironic that the economic downturn may provide some respite to the industry.	EXPE
Some hotel projects are unlikely to be implemented now and the weak Ringgit will also discourage travelling abroad, and thus encourage domestic tourism.	EXPE
Besides, the devaluation makes it cheaper for foreigners to visit Malaysia.	EVAL
Furthermore, Low said the current problems are pushing hotel owners and operators into working together for the good of all.	VERB
`We've met and discussed some issues,' he said.	VERB
`There are many areas we can work together but at the moment I'm not at liberty to reveal them.	VERB
One obvious area, however, where we can cooperate is by marketing the country together, to give foreigners a reason to come and stay in our hotels.'	VERB
On their part, the authorities could promote in addition to the Commonwealth Games, other world-class sporting and cultural events in Malaysia, he said.	VERB
This would generate global publicity and tempt some foreigners to visit.	VERB
But all these are ideas yet to be implemented.	EVAL
Who knows what will happen in the future?	EVAL
For now, one thing is for sure.	EVAL
While it may be difficult for hotel owners and operators to smile in these tough times, frontline employees will be under strict orders to flash those pearly whites at the few they serve.	EVAL

UNIONDALE,	HIST
N.Y. _	HIST
Nearly five years ago, when the Islanders drafted right wing Todd Bertuzzi in the first round and defenseman Bryan McCabe in the second, the plan was to rebuild the organization around them, as well as other talented young players.	HIST
But that vision will not be realized.	MAIN
In a move that left one player teary-eyed and the other one rattled, the Islanders Friday traded McCabe, the team's 22-year-old captain, and Bertuzzi, a 23-year-old underachiever, along with a 1998 third-round draft pick, to the Vancouver Canucks.	MAIN
In exchange, the Islanders received Trevor Linden, the marquee forward General Manager Mike Milbury had sought for months.	MAIN
The trade came hours before a midnight deadline imposed by the National Hockey League as part of a freeze over the next two and a half weeks as many of the National Hockey League's players compete at the Winter Olympics.	CIRC
With the Islanders struggling to score goals this season, the opportunity to acquire Linden, a 27-year-old two-time All-Star and former captain of the Canucks, was simply too good for Milbury to pass up, no matter the asking price.	EVAL
``It's a big trade,''	VERB
Coach Rick Bowness said.	VERB
``It's a tough trade, too.	VERB
You're losing a couple of young guys in Bryan and Todd.	VERB
But if you want a player like Trevor Linden, you have to give up something.	VERB
Obviously, we are excited.	VERB
He will be good for us.'	VERB
' Linden has struggled in each of the last two seasons, suffering injuries to both knees.	VERB
He said Friday evening by telephone that he had resumed skating with the Canucks Friday morning and planned to play for the Canadian Olympic team.	VERB
Linden, a right wing who also plays center, will not play for the Islanders on Saturday against the Devils at Nassau Coliseum.	VERB
A 10-year veteran of the Canucks, Linden enjoyed his best season in 1995-96 when he recorded 33 goals and 47 assists.	HIST
He has 247 goals and 302 assists in 702 career games.	HIST
In addition to the injuries, Coach Mike Keenan's public criticisms also made Linden unhappy.	CIRC
He was also upset after Mark Messier replaced him as captain of the Canucks after Messier arrived as a free agent at the start of the season.	CIRC
McCabe was teary-eyed after he received news of the trade.	CONS
Walking slowly down the hallway between the visitor and home-team dressing rooms at Nassau Coliseum, he went into the Islanders' room, stopped to speak to Bertuzzi for a moment, then collected his personal items from his stall.	CONS
``I was shocked,''	VERB
McCabe said outside the Islanders' dressing room.	VERB
``I'm more sad than anything.	VERB
I've been with these guys for three years.	VERB
I don't want to leave the boys.'	VERB
Bertuzzi sounded more optimistic.	VERB
``Things weren't working out here,'' said Bertuzzi, who had a disappointing seven goals and 11 assists in 52 games with the Islanders.	VERB
``I'm a little rattled, but looking forward to the new start, nothing but good things.''	VERB

WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a letter to the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, by President Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, as provided by Kendall:	LEAD
``The leaking by your office has reached an intolerable point.	VERB
The covert dissemination of both accurate and inaccurate information by your staff violates Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, case law, Department of Justice guidelines, rules of court and well-established ethical prohibitions.	VERB
At your press conference yesterday, you paid lip service to your legal and ethical obligations, remarking that you could not respond concerning the status of `someone who might be a witness' because `that goes to the heart of the grand jury process.' ...	VERB
``Events of recent days make a mockery of your earnest verbal professions.	VERB
Far more accurate is your candid recognition that, `I regret that there have been instances, so it would appear, when that rule has not been abided by.'	VERB
`So it would appear' hardly does justice to the deluge of leaks which quite obviously stem from your office.	VERB
In the past four years, I have written you in confidence about the various leaks that have occurred from your office.	VERB
I am making this letter public today because of the calculated tactic your office is now employing of selectively releasing both information &UR; and falsehoods, &LR; in an attempt to pressure, manipulate, intimidate witnesses and possible witnesses, affect public opinion in your favor and cause political harm to the President.	VERB
I intend to seek judicial relief from these tactics, including contempt sanctions, as soon as practicable, under Rule 6 (e), Barry v. United States, 865 F.2d 1317 (	VERB
D.C. Cir. 1989), and other available legal doctrines.	VERB
``The appalling disregard for the legal and ethical requirements of grand jury and investigative confidentiality and the cynical dissemination of information and misinformation from your office leads me to believe that you have lost control.	VERB
These leaks are deeply unfair and prejudicial.	VERB
You have a solemn duty to ferret out these leaks and regain command and control of your staff.	VERB
The leaks erode a fundamental and venerable principle of the grand jury (an investigative body enshrined in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution) that investigations shall be conducted in secret so that those suspected but not charged with crimes will not have their reputations besmirched, without having a forum in which to cleanse those reputations.	VERB
``A report on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News illustrates, however, what is now commonplace _ legally protected grand jury material strategically leaked from your office.	VERB
Matters have gotten so out of hand that NBC's report on the immunity negotiations between your office and Ms. Lewinsky looks very much like an independent counsel press release.	VERB
In the space of three paragraphs, the NBC correspondent refers directly at least four times to `sources' in your office.	VERB
For example, she states that `sources in Starr's office have told NBC news that the information Lewinsky's lawyers were offering was simply not enough' and that ``sources in Starr's office believe the ((talking points))	VERB
instructions came from the White House.	VERB
``Perhaps more pernicious even is a leak two days ago to The Wall Street Journal, purporting to recount the grand jury testimony of a White House steward, Mr. Nelvis.	VERB
We now know that the leak _ attributed to `two individuals familiar with his testimony,' which is obviously a narrow group centered in your office _ is `totally false.'	VERB
Yet the report was nonetheless spread widely as though true, and was extremely damaging both to the President and Mr. Nelvis.	VERB
It also broadcast to the world the kind of evidence you would like to gather, inviting copycat `testimony' and the like.	VERB
That's a dangerous and destructive game to play in an alleged search for the truth.	VERB
It's why these investigations must be conducted in secret and why the leaks must stop.	VERB
``Today's news reports offer more of the same.	VERB
A front-page article in today's New York Times is headlined	VERB
`Aide's Statements Are Said to Differ From President's,' and the passive voice tells all.	VERB
The article, a flagrant leak from your staff, purports to report what the President's personal secretary, Ms. Betty Currie, has told `investigators' &UR; (i.e. your agents), &LR; and these statements are sourced to `lawyers familiar with her account' &UR; (i.e. your legal staff) &LR; .	VERB
This combination is repeated throughout the article:	VERB
``Paragraph 1: `President Clinton's personal secretary has told investigators ... according to lawyers familiar with her account.' ``Paragraph 4&AMP;5: `Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the lawyers said.	VERB
The lawyers also said.	VERB
' ``Paragraph 6: `Mrs. Currie has told investigators ... the lawyers said.' ``Paragraphs 12 &AMP; 17: `Mrs. Currie has been extensively interviewed by agents and prosecutors from Mr. Starr's office. ...	VERB
According to the account provided by the lawyers, Mrs. Currie said. ...'	VERB
``And so on.	VERB
Mrs. Currie's own lawyer has stated that, except for the one sentence statement explicitly attributed to him in the article, this information did not come from Mrs. Currie or her attorneys.	VERB
In context, the `lawyers familiar with the inquiry,' so frequently quoted in the article, are plainly members of your staff.	VERB
``The NBC report, The Wall Street Journal account and today's New York Times article are not anomalies.	VERB
Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous such selective leaks directly traceable to your office	VERB
_ the accuracy of which, I might add, are often highly suspect.	VERB
``As I have repeatedly pointed out previously in my letters over the past four years, and as you must be aware, it is illegal and wrong to attempt to manipulate witnesses and possible witnesses, the press, the public and our system of justice by selectively leaking information _ accurate or otherwise.	VERB
Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice	VERB
Relating to Prosecution Function and Fair Trials, the National Prosecution Standards published by the National District Attorneys Association, and the Rules of Professional Conduct for the District of Columbia, among other professional codes of conduct, all forbid leaks of purported confidential information of the kind that have sprung from your office. ...	VERB
``The public disclosure of grand jury and investigative information not only violates Rule 6(e) (2), it runs afoul of ethical and professional standards of conduct for attorneys, prosecutors, and executive branch officials.	VERB
The ABA Standards for Criminal Justice relating to the Prosecution Function provide that `((a)) prosecutor should not make or authorize the making of an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the prosecutor knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing a criminal proceeding.' ...	VERB
``Well, first of all, The Associated Press is reporting tonight that Ken Starr's office has rejected an immunity deal put forward by Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, and sources in Starr's office have told NBC News that the information Lewinsky's lawyers were offering was simply not enough. ...	VERB
The two sides aren't even on the same page.	VERB
They don't rule out an eventual deal, but they say right now Starr wants to focus on accelerating his investigation.	VERB
``And NBC News has learned more about another critical piece of evidence.	VERB
A memo first discovered by Newsweek that Linda Tripp claims was given to her by Monica Lewinsky.	VERB
The memo appears to be instructions on how to lie to Paula Jones's attorneys in her suit against the President.	VERB
Page one of the talking points obtained by NBC weeks ago, was written, according to experts, in a semi-legal language which would be unusual to come from a 24-year-old.	VERB
The second two pages, obtained by NBC today, are less formal, as if they could be notes	VERB
_ more instructions to Tripp on what to say to help the White House.	VERB
In one passage, the notes suggest that Tripp should ignore her own lawyer's advice.	VERB
`He has been saying you should look neutral.	VERB
Better for credibility,' it reads, `that you aren't neutral.'	VERB
``Sources in Starr's office and close to Linda Tripp say they believe the instructions came from the White House.	VERB
If true, that could help support a case of obstruction of justice.	VERB
But sources also tell NBC News Lewinsky has not agreed to discuss any of that with Starr.	VERB
And some of the additional language in the second two pages of the memo is Pentagon jargon.	VERB
That indicates that Lewinsky, who had worked at the Pentagon, could have at least had a hand in crafting the memo.	VERB
One theory, Lewinsky wrote it on her computer, but with the help of someone else, most likely a lawyer.	VERB
Sources say that's one reason why Ken Starr seized Lewinsky's computer.	VERB
And they also tell us from Starr's office that they figure the most corroborating evidence they gather, either that helps their case against the president, or it will help eventually make a better deal with Monica Lewinsky.''	VERB
