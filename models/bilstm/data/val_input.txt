Threats to the resumption of the Northern Ireland peace talks receded today after a British cabinet minister entered the huge Maze prison near Belfast and pressed Protestant guerrillas held there to support continuing the discussions.	LEAD
Northern Ireland Secretary Marjorie Mowlam sat down with members of two outlawed Protestant paramilitary groups and delivered a 14-point statement on why they should reverse a vote they took last weekend to condemn the talks.	MAIN
That vote had thrown the talks' future into question.	MAIN
After she left, the prisoners did what she asked.	MAIN
The political party that speaks for them at the negotiating table, the Ulster Democratic Party, announced it was no longer considering boycotting the talks, which are set to resume Monday.	MAIN
Another party affiliated with imprisoned Protestant guerrillas, the Progressive Unionist Party, said it would decide on Sunday whether to attend.	MAIN
The all-party talks, chaired by former U.S. senator George J. Mitchell (D-Maine), seek a political solution in Northern Ireland between Protestants, most of whom want to remain part of Britain, and Catholics, who want greater political rights, including, for some, political union with the Republic of Ireland to the south.	CIRC
We are very unhappy about it," said Glyn Roberts, development officer for a Northern Ireland peace group called Families Against Intimidation and Terror.	VERB
Mowlam spoke directly with terrorists, he said, "which many victims felt was grossly insulting.	VERB
Throughout the conflict, the British government has held to the line that it talks to people who renounce violence, not to killers.	PREV
To many people in Britain, it seemed today that Mowlam was being summoned by men convicted of crimes that include murder and arson.	EVAL
Mowlam denied being summoned to the prison or submitting to guerrilla threats.	VERB
There was no metaphorical gun at my head," she said.	VERB
She also denied offering the prisoners any concessions.	VERB
Rather, she said, she delivered a message that their concerns -- particularly that their release be part of any peace accord -- could be addressed only if talks continue.	VERB
Currently, 539 people convicted of offenses related to the sectarian conflict live in the huge walled facility known as the Maze.	CIRC
Their influence in the talks is among the starker paradoxes of the conflict.	CIRC
Addressing reporters after her visit, Mowlam apologized to people who took offense.	VERB
But she depicted the trip as part of her commitment to do whatever it takes to keep the peace talks on track.	VERB
If we manage to get people round the table on Monday," she said, "we have a chance to move this process forward.	VERB
Though the British government keeps them locked up, it must also keep in mind their views, because they are viewed as heroes and prisoners of war by many people on the outside.	CIRC
Their approval is considered key to any settlement.	CIRC
About half the prisoners are members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and its spinoffs, which want Northern Ireland to become part of Ireland.	CIRC
The others are members of various illegal loyalist armed groups that want Northern Ireland to remain a British province.	CIRC
The prisoners affiliated with the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster Freedom Fighters became the focus of the crisis in recent days.	CIRC
Angry over the murder of a hard-line loyalist leader in the Maze and the release of IRA prisoners in the Irish republic, they voted to withdraw support for the talks.	CIRC
A statement issued by the two groups after Mowlam's visit said they had reversed their previous vote, but added that this "does not represent a change in our assessment of the talks.	VERB
Many members of the Protestant community feel frustrated over the talks, saying that Catholics are getting all the concessions.	VERB
On Thursday, in an attempt to dispel reports that the prisoners are virtually in charge at the Maze, prison authorities opened the doors to British journalists and cameras.	CONS
Inside they filmed barbed wire, tall walls and other security measures -- and prisoner living areas that were done up as paramilitary barracks.	CONS
Unit names, coats of arms, militant slogans and pictures of masked men with automatic weapons had been painted on walls.	CIRC
Prisoners wore no uniforms and relaxed in easy chairs with books and television.	CIRC
In television interviews, prisoners generally played down their influence on the talks.	VERB
We are in fact the symptom of the situation which exists in Northern Ireland," said Michael Stone, who was convicted of the murder of three people at an IRA funeral in 1988.	VERB
At the end of the day we are only a component part of the process.	VERB

BRUSSELS- Even before it is played out, the Iraq crisis is having a profound effect on a debate within NATO over how the Atlantic security partnership should define its strategic interests for the next century.	LEAD
While European allies have closed ranks behind the United States in the latest showdown with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, there are lingering apprehensions among NATO governments about the Clinton administration's insistence on recognizing the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as the alliance's most urgent priority.	CIRC
At a meeting of NATO foreign ministers here two months ago, Secretary of State Madeleine K.

U.S. Ambassador to NATO Alexander Vershbow said Albright's suggestions were primarily intended to stimulate discussion of a "strategic concept" being prepared for a summit in Washington next April to celebrate NATO's 50th anniversary.	VERB
While the debate is still in its early stages, Vershbow said in an interview that the United States wants the new strategic statement "to lay out a bold vision for the next century and to provide practical guidance to our military structures on how resources can be shifted to meet these new kinds of threats.

He said the United States considers it necessary for European governments to expand their power-projection capabilities to relieve some of the burdens on American forces in defending alliance security interests outside Europe.	VERB
Failure to do so, he said, could lead to erosion of U.S. support "if the allies are seen to be getting a free ride.	VERB
Albright addressed this perceptual problem at the December meeting, telling her European colleagues that "too often, the United States takes the heat for dealing with difficult issues while others take the contracts -- and that our willingness to take responsibility for peace and security makes it easier for others to shirk theirs.

The head of the International Monetary Fund wrote a private letter to Indonesia's President Suharto threatening to cut off bailout money because of a dispute over economic policy, raising the prospect that the international effort to stem Asia's financial crisis could come unglued.	LEAD
President Clinton called Suharto last night to reinforce the IMF position in the dispute, administration officials said yesterday.	CONS
The confrontation between the Indonesian president and his would-be rescuers came as Indonesia's crisis deepened across both economic and political lines.	CIRC
The Indonesian rupiah, which had been climbing, plunged as much as 24 percent against the U.S. dollar.	CIRC
And the country suffered one of the worst outbreaks of violence since the onset of its economic troubles, with thousands of rioters in four towns looting and burning shops in protest over rising food prices.	CIRC
The letter from IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, which was dated Wednesday and obtained by The Washington Post, came in response to evidence that Suharto is planning to change Indonesia's monetary system radically, adopting a Hong Kong-style "currency board" in which the value of the rupiah would be rigidly fixed against the dollar and the Indonesian authorities essentially would abandon control over interest rates.	CIRC
The IMF staff, backed by the U.S. Treasury and economic officials in other major countries, believes that Indonesia is at present incapable of credibly sustaining such a fixed exchange rate.	CIRC
Camdessus wrote that if Jakarta implemented the move anytime soon, he would urge the board of the 182-nation organization to suspend the $ 43 billion bailout of Indonesia's economy.	CIRC
The imbroglio over the seemingly arcane currency issue threatens to plunge Indonesia -- and possibly its neighbors as well -- into a renewed bout of financial turmoil, analysts said.	CONS
The stock markets and currencies of Indonesia and several other ailing Asian countries, including South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia, have recovered some of their losses in recent weeks.	CIRC
The growing sense of stability raised hope in financial capitals and official circles that the worst of the region's financial problems may have passed following the commitment of more than $ 100 billion in loans from the IMF, World Bank and wealthy nations to the region.	CIRC
But Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country, is widely viewed by analysts and officials alike as the nation most likely to drag the region back into crisis.	EXPE
The rupiah, which fell as much as 80 percent from its value last summer, remains severely depressed, making imports hugely expensive -- so much so that many manufacturing companies cannot afford to import the raw materials they need.	PREV
And amid increased incidents of rioting in recent weeks, fears are rising that the country could become engulfed by social unrest and attacks by majority Muslims against the ethnic Chinese minority that might undermine stability throughout Asia.	PREV
Warning that Indonesia's problems could spread quickly, the governor of the country's central bank, Soedradjad Djiwandono, was quoted as saying in wire service reports yesterday that "contagion effects can be rapid, overwhelming and costly even to countries that have maintained consistently sound economic policies.	VERB
The rupiah's slide, to as low as 9,600 per dollar from 7,300 per dollar yesterday, drove other Southeast Asian currencies downward, including the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit, although the other currencies later rose as the rupiah recovered to about 8,600 per dollar.	CIRC
Fueling the currency drops were reports that the clash between Suharto and the IMF was intensifying over the currency board issue, which aroused fears that Indonesia would lose international backing that it badly needs to restore investor confidence.	CONS
Suharto has made it clear that he favors a currency board plan championed by a Johns Hopkins University professor, Steve H. Hanke, to fix the exchange rate permanently at about 5,000 rupiah per dollar.	CIRC
Under a currency board, a country's monetary authorities essentially pledge to put stability in the exchange rate above all other objectives, including economic growth, cheap credit and employment.	EVAL
They maintain a large reserve of dollars available to exchange the local currency at the fixed rate, and promise not to print more money without adding to their reserve of dollars.	EVAL
Among the most successful examples of currency boards is Argentina's, which eliminated hyperinflation after implementing the approach in 1991, although the Buenos Aires regime has suffered through periods of very high interest rates and recession to maintain its fixed rate of one peso per dollar.	EVAL
Contacted by phone in Jakarta where he arrived yesterday to meet with Suharto, Hanke blasted the Clinton administration and the IMF for trying to torpedo his idea.	VERB
He noted that the rupiah had staged a powerful rally earlier this week as news emerged that a currency board might soon be introduced -- and that its partial recovery from Friday's tailspin came after he announced at a news conference that Suharto plans to press ahead with a board.	VERB
We're completely puzzled as to why the Clinton administration and the IMF seems intent on destabilizing the currency and the country," Hanke said.	VERB
All the other currencies in the region are going up and down with the rupiah.	VERB
So they [the administration and the IMF] are destabilizing the whole region.	VERB
If this currency board doesn't go ahead, we're going to have total meltdown.	VERB
But in Washington, the IMF was issuing its strongest public criticism to date of Jakarta's proposed adoption of a currency board, and a special IMF representative, Prabhakar Narvekar, met with Suharto in an effort to dissuade him, according to wire service reports.	VERB
In a speech, Camdessus said he was of "the strong view" that the time for a fixed currency in Indonesia "has not yet come," because "a number of preconditions have to be satisfied.	VERB
Among these, he said, was the need for Jakarta to obtain substantial reserves of dollars and strengthen the country's battered banking system.	VERB
If Indonesia fixed its exchange rate without holding more dollars in reserve, it would invite speculators to attack the rupiah, the IMF believes, and Indonesia's cash-strapped banks might collapse if the authorities gave up their ability to print money.	VERB
Camdessus and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers declined to answer reporters' questions yesterday about whether the IMF would cut off funding to Indonesia.	VERB
In his letter, however, Camdessus wrote: "In the present circumstances . . . if a currency board proposal were adopted, we would not be able to recommend to the IMF Board the continuation of the present program because of the risks to the Indonesian economy.	VERB
This would be a very unfortunate development, as it would shrink even further the reserve basis for the currency board and further undermine its very slim chances of success.	VERB
Camdessus said the IMF might favor a currency board for Indonesia once the necessary conditions are met.	VERB
Hanke retorted that in his opinion, Indonesia already has met the necessary conditions, and he said he doesn't believe Suharto will capitulate to IMF pressure.	VERB

The usually soft-spoken Perdue will travel to Annapolis on Wednesday to defend his industry at a House of Delegates hearing where lawmakers will take up plans to fight the toxic microbe Pfiesteria piscicida by threatening farmers with sanctions if they don't limit the amount of manure they use as fertilizer.	MAIN
James A. Perdue, chairman of the poultry empire that bears his family's name, probably is best known for his appearances in television commercials selling chicken.	LEAD
But he finds himself in a new role these days, fending off charges that his industry is to blame for despoiling the Chesapeake Bay.	LEAD
In a rare hour-and-a-half interview here at Perdue Farms' corporate headquarters -- a rectangle of offices across the street from the farmhouse where his grandfather, Arthur Perdue, launched what is now the nation's second-largest poultry company 78 years ago -- the grandson scoffed at suggestions the bay is critically threatened.	CONS
He accused Maryland officials of peddling bogus science in proclaiming that chicken manure is washing off the land and fueled last summer's outbreaks of pfiesteria.	CONS
Mostly, he worried about the costs attached to legislation championed by Gov. Parris N. Glendening (D), which would force farmers to do something else with the chicken manure they now use as fertilizer.	CONS
There's a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety," he said.	VERB
If the farmer goes out of business here, we can't grow our chickens on the [Eastern] Shore.	VERB
It's going to put our plants out of business on the Shore.	VERB
While even the governor's economic development secretary has expressed concern that the state's business reputation may be on the line in the debate over pfiesteria, several trade analysts said talk of major poultry companies packing up and leaving probably is exaggerated.	VERB
The integrators like Perdue that process and market the birds "aren't going to leave Maryland," said John C. Bierbusse, a food analyst with A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis.	VERB
The fixed assets are in place, the growers are there. . . .	VERB
You can't just pick up a processing plant and move it.	VERB
But others worry the industry could phase out operations here, spending new capital in places where doing business is cheaper.	VERB
I'm not going to build or enlarge a plant here if I'm not going to be able to do business efficiently," said Leonard Teitelbaum, a food analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.	VERB
I may keep my old ones, but I won't build any new ones.	VERB
Maryland's poultry industry dates to the 1920s, when farmers who raised fruits and vegetables for sale in big cities such as Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York opted to add chicken-houses to supplement their income.	HIST
The sideline has since matured into an industry that annually produces 300 million chickens worth more than $ 1 billion, exporting the birds as far as Russia and China.	HIST
The Perdue family says it is descended from French Huguenots who landed near Assateague Island in the 17th century, subsisting on the timber trade for several centuries before turning to farming.	HIST
Given such roots, the modern-day clan leader frowns at suggestions his family's profitability rests on the right to pollute the Chesapeake.	HIST
He calls himself an environmentalist.	HIST
I drink water out of the ground here," said Perdue, who shares the penetrating gaze of his father, Frank Perdue, the man who made the company a household name with ads that bragged it took a tough man to make a tender chicken.	VERB
I fish in the bay with my son.	VERB
This idea of the Chesapeake being a dying bay is ridiculous," he said.	VERB
The bay is in the process of being cleaned up.	VERB
He was equally dismissive of Glendening's pfiesteria commission, headed by former governor Harry R. Hughes, which declared that curbing the flow of pollutants in animal manure into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay was the most promising strategy against the toxic microbe.	VERB
He called that finding "a nothing statement, a 'we-don't have-enough-facts' statement.	VERB
Perdue especially was critical of Glendening's decision to pursue mandatory limits on fertilizers, rather than the voluntary program favored by his industry.	VERB
He accused Glendening of opting "to punish farmers, when he ought to pat them on the back.	VERB
If the costs of any one thing goes up, you can't survive," he said.	VERB
Glendening's bill is being offered at a time when poultry producers across the country are struggling with higher feed prices, sagging exports and competition from lower-priced beef.	CIRC
Perdue said circumstances in Maryland are particularly dire, because production costs here already are higher than in other regions of the country.	VERB
He worried that Glendening's initiative could push his industry over the edge, forcing it to shift operations elsewhere.	VERB
James Perdue received a doctorate in fisheries from the University of Washington, before returning to Maryland and the family business in 1983.	HIST
He said links between farm pollution and pfiesteria are merely "circumstantial," and he pilloried those who offer the microbe as evidence that the Chesapeake is in mortal danger.	VERB

BTG Inc.'s chairman yesterday rescinded the dismissals of four vice presidents who were unexpectedly fired Monday after an abortive bid to purchase a BTG division, company sources said.	LEAD
The executives were allowed to resign instead.	LEAD
Ed Bersoff, the Fairfax company's chief executive, announced the decision in a company-wide electronic message sent out after 5 p.m. The e-mail message, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, said the four vice presidents have "chosen to resign effective February 6, 1998, to pursue other interests.	MAIN
I regret any disruptions that may have been caused to these individuals or others in the company.	MAIN
The e-mail was part of a settlement agreement between BTG and the four vice presidents.	MAIN
Neither party would discuss the details of the settlement.	MAIN
The vice presidents -- Scott Reynolds, Paul Collins, Steve Schlosser and Brian Nightingale -- had joined with another company vice president to make a $ 28 million cash bid for the company's technology systems division.	CIRC
BTG had previously agreed to sell the division to a fierce rival, Chantilly-based Government Technology Services Inc., for about $ 23 million in cash and stock, but the five BTG executives never appeared to have lined up viable financing for their offer.	CIRC
BTG expects to close the deal with GTSI in the next few days.	EXPE
The division being sold is a fast-growing but marginally profitable unit that filled large computer orders from government agencies.	EXPE
On Monday morning at 11:30, Bersoff fired the four vice presidents at an impromptu meeting.	MAIN
Four lower-level staffers who worked closely with the executives also were fired later that day; Bersoff rescinded those terminations too, according to the e-mail company employees received yesterday.	MAIN
Steve Baldwin, the fifth BTG vice president involved in the management bid, resigned Monday night.	MAIN
Baldwin, the most senior official within the management group, said yesterday he has a number of issues with BTG left to be resolved "that I am assessing as I move forward.	MAIN
Bersoff leveled several allegations against the vice presidents as he fired them Monday, but no one present at the meeting would discuss them on the record.	CONS
Later Monday, however, Bersoff sent out a company-wide e-mail in which he said the four vice presidents had been fired "with cause" and that they had engaged in activities "designed to disrupt BTG's operation and to put the job of all the technology systems employees at risk.	CIRC
The vice presidents vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and spent much of the week meeting with their lawyers.	VERB
We are pleased on behalf of the terminated officers and employees to have achieved the recision of the termination for cause," said Jack McKay, an attorney at the Washington office of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge who is representing eight of the nine BTG employees who left the company.	VERB
My clients are very satisfied with the e-mail that was distributed today.	VERB
Bersoff, who was reached in Hawaii, where he is attending a conference, would not comment on the firings or yesterday's e-mail beyond saying, "The parties have reached an amicable resolution of their differences.	VERB

US Airways Group Inc. announced plans yesterday to repurchase nearly $ 1 billion in stock and retire another $ 379 million in debt to bolster the airline's financial position as it prepares to start new low-cost operations on the East Coast.	MAIN
US Airways Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who took over the financially troubled airline two years ago, said the move was designed to reduce interest and dividend payments, improve the Arlington-based company's balance sheet and improve shareholder value.	VERB
Wolf said in a statement that since he became chairman, the airline has made "tremendous strides" in both its operating and financial performance and now is in a position to use its nearly $ 2 billion in cash to strengthen the value of its stock.	VERB
US Airways recently negotiated contract concessions from its pilots and is in talks with its other unions on similar contracts as it plans to launch low-cost service out of Baltimore Washington International airport soon to compete on the East Coast with Southwest Airlines and Delta Express, Delta's low-cost operation.	CIRC
The airline said it plans to buy back up to $ 500 million worth of common stock as well as $ 358 million in preferred stock held by billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett through affiliates of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Buffett, who made the investment in 1989, has the option of converting his holdings into 9.24 million shares of the airline's common stock at a conversion price of $ 38.74 a share before US Airways redeems his preferred shares.	MAIN
US Airways stock closed yesterday at $ 62.12 1/2 a share.	CONS
If Buffett converts and then sells his common shares, he would pocket a profit of more than $ 216 million, not counting at least $ 264 million he's earned in dividend payments.	EVAL
It was unclear yesterday whether Buffett would sell or keep the common stock once he converts his preferred.	CIRC
In a statement released by his office in Omaha, Buffett praised Wolf for the management changes he has made and said "after a dismaying period, we are very pleased with our investment in US Airways.	VERB
Buffett had once told shareholders that his investment in the company had been a "mistake.	VERB
When all of the transactions announced yesterday are completed, the airline said it still would have "significantly more" than $ 1 billion in cash, assuming a full $ 500 million stock repurchase.	CONS
Wolf and US Airways President Rakesh Gangwal are scheduled to outline the financial moves, as well as the company's plans for the year, in New York today to the Society of Airline Analysts.	CONS
In addition to the new operation out of Baltimore, the airline is in the midst of a major aircraft purchase from Airbus Industrie to eventually replace its hodgepodge fleet of planes.	CIRC
US Airways also is negotiating with Boeing and Airbus for the purchase of new wide-bodied jets for transatlantic service.	CIRC
US Airways also is one of the few major airlines without an overseas alliance with a foreign carrier to help bolster its transatlantic operations.	CIRC
Company officials have said they would wait until the airline was in a position of economic strength before they would seek such a partnership.	CIRC
It was unclear yesterday whether company officials believed they had now reached that point.	CIRC

Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today urged Russia and four other European nations to step up punitive sanctions against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until he shows greater cooperation in defusing the conflict in the Serbian province of Kosovo.	MAIN
But as she arrived here to prepare for a meeting in Bonn Wednesday to discuss what to do about Kosovo, Albright appeared to be waging a lonely campaign to persuade others in the six-nation Balkans "contact group" to sustain a tough attitude toward the Yugoslav government.	EVAL
Only Britain shares the U.S. view that Milosevic, whose rump nation consists of Serbia and Montenegro, is more likely to respond to sticks than carrots in meeting demands that he withdraw special police units from Kosovo and make a serious effort to restore political autonomy to the 2 million Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.	CIRC
Russia, France, Italy and Germany have expressed varying degrees of satisfaction with Milosevic's behavior since the contact group agreed to a series of sanctions against Yugoslavia at a meeting in London two weeks ago.	CIRC
At that meeting, the group agreed to consider a comprehensive arms embargo against Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, a halt to supplying equipment that could be used for repression, a denial of visas to Yugoslav officials involved in the crackdown and an end to export credits to Belgrade for trade and investment.	PREV
The contact group last met March 9 in the aftermath of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians that followed a series of attacks by separatist guerrillas against Serbian police in Kosovo.	PREV
At least 80 people, many of them women and children, were killed by Serbian police and paramilitary forces in the crackdown.	PREV
Russia, a long-standing ally of the Serbs and their main supplier of weapons, has spurned compliance with the comprehensive arms embargo and balked at further sanctions against Yugoslavia.	CIRC
Albright held discussions here this evening with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov	CONS
but there was no sign that Moscow was moving closer toward Washington's views.	EVAL
The violence has subsided since then, although the province remains tense, especially in strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an Albanian separatist guerrilla group.	CIRC
On Monday, Serbian and ethnic Albanian leaders signed an agreement that would allow Albanian high school and university students to return to state classrooms, seven years after Serbian authorities banned their Albanian-language curriculum.	CIRC
During a six-hour stopover in Rome to consult with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and Vatican officials, Albright said Serbia's response had not been sufficient to ease international pressure.	MAIN
She called on the rest of the contact group to maintain sanctions until Yugoslavia complies fully with its demands.	MAIN
We have seen too many diplomatic efforts fail to believe that President Milosevic will respond to positive pressure alone.	MAIN
And if we give him even a shadow of a glimmer of a hint that he has done enough, he will assuredly do no more," she said.	MAIN
She insisted that Milosevic has stopped far short of doing what is necessary.	MAIN
Serbian security police are digging in, not pulling out; Milosevic has still not committed himself to unconditional dialogue; aid workers continue to be harassed, and the list goes on.	MAIN
In contrast, Dini praised Milosevic for taking some steps in the right direction and said there was no reason for the group to be "entirely dissatisfied" with Yugoslavia's behavior over the past two weeks.	VERB
During a visit to Belgrade last week, foreign ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany and Hubert Vedrine of France told Milosevic they welcomed "significant progress" he showed toward meeting the group's demands.	VERB
U.S. officials said they wanted to "prevent backsliding" toward Yugoslavia.	VERB
This is not the time to reverse course," a senior administration official said.	VERB
What we want is to be leading the group to understand that without pressure he [Milosevic] will not respond.	VERB
To show U.S. displeasure with Belgrade, Albright said she will sign an order barring 16 Yugoslav officials involved in the Kosovo crackdown from entering the United States.	CONS
We have too much experience in the former Yugoslavia to settle for half-sincere half measures," she said.	CONS
We will need to maintain credible pressure on Belgrade to end repression and restore autonomy" in Kosovo.	CONS
But European allies predict that Milosevic will respond to encouraging gestures by taking further steps toward peace.	CONS
Some European companies want to see sanctions lifted so they can take advantage of early investments in Yugoslavia's privatization plans, which they believe offer the prospect of easy profits.	CONS

Judith Evans, Washington Post Staff Writer Host Marriott Corp., the Bethesda-based hotel owner, will announce today that it will pay $ 1.7 billion to buy 13 luxury hotels from Blackstone Real Estate Advisors II L.P., spin off its nursing homes into a separately traded public company and convert its hotel operations into a real estate investment trust.	LEAD
Host's purchase includes such highly prized properties as the Drake Hotel in New York City, the Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island and the Hyatt Regency Reston.	MAIN
The aim of Host Marriott's reorganization is to cash in on Wall Street's fascination with REITs, broadening the appeal of the company's shares among investors who in the past had been cool to the stock, said sources familiar with the deal.	VERB
As a REIT, Host Marriott will have better access to less expensive financing and a lower tax bill, because it will pay out nearly all of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.	CIRC
Shareholders then pay the taxes on that income.	CIRC
The REIT form of corporate structure has recently become a popular way for hotel companies to own and operate their properties.	CIRC
The Blackstone purchase will give Host 55,000 rooms, or $ 10 billion in assets, compared with 26,000 rooms when it first became a public company in 1993.	CONS
More importantly, sources said, the quality of the company's hotels will improve, with nearly 55 percent of its properties considered luxury, full-service hotels, compared with only 20 percent five years ago.	CONS
Officials from Marriott and Blackstone would not comment on the transaction yesterday.	VERB
Host Marriott's moves also mark a significant turnaround for the company.	HIST
It was spun off in 1993 as a separate company from Marriott International Inc., which now builds and manages hotels.	HIST
At the time, investors and analysts were skittish about Host because the company carried massive debt and had divergent operations, including running food and beverage concessions for airports and travel plazas.	HIST
Host Marriott in 1995 shed the concessions business, which now operates as a publicly traded company, Host Marriott Services.	HIST
In the past five years, the company has reduced its ratio of debt to its total market to 47 percent from 75 percent.	HIST
The company's strategy is to improve that to 35 percent by refinancing debt at lower interest rates through a conversion to a REIT.	HIST
The complex deal calls for Host Marriott to pay $ 835 million in cash and debt, as well as 47 million operating partnership units in the REIT, for the Blackstone hotels.	CIRC
Blackstone will own about 19 percent of Host Marriott's outstanding shares.	CIRC
John Schreiber, a partner in Blackstone, will join Host Marriott's board of directors.	CIRC
Shareholders can exchange the partnership shares for one share of Host Marriott common stock, at which time they will have to pay taxes on the transaction.	VERB
But sources familiar with the deal said that in 1999, it will add 26 cents a share on an estimated $ 800 million in funds from operations, a key measure of financial performance for REITs.	VERB
Analysts had estimated Host Marriott would generate earnings of $ 2.15 a share for 1999.	VERB
Host Marriott expects to complete its conversion to a REIT by January 1999.	EXPE
The deal is subject to shareholder approval, even though it will have no effect on the existing stock ownership.	EXPE
But as part of spinning off the senior living communities, Host Marriott will repurchase $ 1.55 billion of outstanding debt securities.	EXPE
In the new senior living company, which has yet to be named, Host Marriott shareholders will receive one share of stock for each share they now hold and a cash distribution of as much as $ 1 a share.	CONS
It is a taxable transaction that Host Marriott estimates will range from $ 400 million to $ 500 million.	CONS
The company hopes the cash will help shareholders cover the taxes on the transaction.	CONS
The new company will own 31 luxury retirement facilities in 12 states, mostly those built and constructed by Marriott International.	CONS
Analysts had expected Host Marriott to join a cadre of hospitality companies forming REITs, including CapStar Hotel Co., which announced last month that it will merge with American General into a "paper-clipped" REIT.	VERB
The Clinton administration in January proposed eliminating the tax-free status of mergers between "paired-shared" REITs after industry criticism that that status helped Starwood Hotels & Lodging beat out the competition in purchasing ITT Corp. and Westin Hotels.	PREV
A paired-shared REIT operates and manages properties in a C corporation and a REIT, which trade separately.	PREV
A paper-clipped REIT trades as one stock.	PREV
The "paper clipped" REIT and Host's conversion to an "umbrella partnership" REIT are less controversial structures in the industry and among lawmakers than paired-shared REITs.	PREV
Host Marriott's REIT will allow its stock to trade at a higher value, allowing the company to use its stock to bid more for properties, several analysts have said.	EXPE
The company will also be more attractive to sellers because they can receive Host Marriott stock in exchange for the real estate.	EXPE
It fits very cleanly" for Host Marriott to become a REIT, said Mark Mutkoski, a lodging analyst for Bankers Trust New York.	VERB
They have proven in the past that they can acquire properties for a good price and improve their cash flow.	VERB

Two more multibillion-dollar deals by financial firms were announced today, bolstering Wall Street's conviction that this week's marriage of Citicorp and Travelers Group signals a new bout of merger mania.	LEAD
Household International Inc., one of the nation's largest consumer lenders, agreed to buy Beneficial Corp., another giant consumer finance company, in an $ 8.6 billion deal.	MAIN
And Conseco Inc., a life and health insurer, agreed to buy Green Tree Financial Corp. in a $ 7.6 billion arrangement.	MAIN
Despite the financial deals, the overall stock market retreated from the record high set by blue-chip stocks on Monday.	CONS
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 76.73 points, or 0.85 percent, to 8956.50, just one day after it closed above 9000 for the first time ever.	CONS
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.83 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1109.55.	CONS
The steepest drop came in the Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled 30.43 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1798.71.	CONS
Money managers and analysts attributed part of the drop to fears that corporate profits are slowing, triggered by Motorola Inc.'s warning that its sales have been hurt by Asia's economic troubles and competition from European rivals.	EVAL
Some investors also are skeptical about the plan to merge Citicorp and Travelers.	CONS
Both stocks declined today after big gains Monday, with Citicorp falling 15 3/8, to 165 1/8, and Travelers declining 4 5/8, to 68 3/8.	CONS
Other financial shares also dropped, including J.P. Morgan, which fell 4-11/16, to 139-15/16.	CONS
Although today's mergers are only a fraction of the size of the $ 82 billion Citicorp-Travelers deal, they reflect the same strategic imperative to grow in size and efficiency or lose out in the fast-changing financial services industry.	EVAL
Officials at Household International and Beneficial said in a statement that their combination will "have the financial strength, portfolio balance and expanded market presence that will allow us to provide superior returns for shareholders.	VERB
Our employees and customers will also benefit," the statement said.	VERB
Conseco and Green Tree officials said their agreement will ultimately help secure the "Middle America consumer franchise" by offering a wider range of insurance and financial services to 11 million middle-class customers around the country.	VERB
The financial services industry is converging rapidly, as recent events make abundantly clear," said Stephen C. Hilbert, Conseco's president and chief executive.	VERB
Traditional categories, and traditional companies, are disappearing.	VERB
Analysts agreed, saying the new combinations add to the pressure to consolidate and grow larger.	EXPE
This is the view in the industry, that you must be of a certain size to remain competitive. . . . '	VERB
Bigger is better.	VERB
Bigger is more efficient.	VERB
You must be big to survive,' " said Kathryn H. Bissette, a financial industry analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach in Atlanta.	VERB
The idea of consolidation is well underway.	VERB
Among the likely candidates for future deals are Chase Manhattan Bank and Merrill Lynch, which have been the subject of rumors for months.	EXPE
Analysts also cited J.P. Morgan, PaineWebber and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter as companies that likely felt more vulnerable after the announcement by Citicorp and Travelers.	EXPE
That deal changed the definition of 'large,' " said David Hochstim, an equity analyst at Bear, Stearns.	VERB
Hochstim said he expects more consolidations.	VERB
This merger suggests that almost anything can be acquired or merged. . . .	VERB
We've had three pretty significant deals in the last two days.	VERB
What's next?	VERB

Turkey sent six F-16 fighter jets to northern Cyprus today in response to Greece's brief deployment of fighter jets to southern Cyprus, and warned Athens against attempting a military buildup on the divided island.	MAIN
As the F-16 deployment was announced, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said the Turkish government will take "all necessary measures" against any Greek plans for aggression against Turkey.	VERB
While Greece and the Greek-Cypriot government condemned the move, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who was in Romania on an official visit, said the possibility of war between Turkey and Greece over Cyprus "largely depends on the Greek-Cypriot attitude.	VERB
The Turkish fighters flew into the Gecitkale Air Base in northern Cyprus two days after four Greek F-16s and a C-130 transport plane landed at the Greek-Cypriot Paphos Air Base for a brief stopover, the first known landings of Greek aircraft at the base since its completion in January.	MAIN
Three of the six Turkish jets reportedly returned to their base near Ankara later today.	MAIN
Greek-Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou told reporters the Greek aircraft stopover sent a "specific political message.	VERB
That the [Greek-Greek Cypriot] common defense doctrine will exist and continue to develop so long as there is Turkish expansionism.	VERB
Turkey condemned the Greek move, calling it an "extremely grave and provocative development.	VERB
Cem accused Athens of developing a strategy to use Cyprus as a springboard in the event of an attack on Turkey.	VERB
Under a 1993 defense pact between the internationally recognized Greek-Cypriot government and Greece, Athens pledged military support to the Greek Cypriots in the event hostilities break out on the Mediterranean island.	PREV
Turkey, which has 30,000 troops in northern Cyprus, has its own defense pact with the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- a nation recognized only by Ankara -- under which Turkey pledges responsibility for the security of the Turkish-Cypriot sector.	CIRC
Britain, which maintains military bases on Cyprus, called for restraint in the wake of the fighter-jet deployments, and a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman in turn said Ankara would ask Britain to help reduce tension on the island.	VERB
Britain is Cyprus's former colonial ruler and is named as a guarantor power, along with Turkey and Greece, under the 1960 Cypriot constitution.	VERB
Greek-Turkish friction over Cyprus has heightened over the past 1 1/2 years, triggering concern in Washington that the heavily militarized island could become a flash point for armed conflict between the NATO allies.	CIRC
Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island to support the Turkish-Cypriot minority after a Greek-backed coup.	HIST
Efforts by the United States and Europe to defuse tension and broker a settlement on Cyprus were set back after the European Union decided last December to begin membership negotiations with the Greek-Cypriot government and at the same time left Turkey off its short list of candidates.	PREV
In the wake of those decisions, Ankara froze political dialogue with the EU and Ankara, and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership hardened their position regarding Cyprus settlement talks.	PREV
Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that the talks be carried out on a state-to-state basis -- which would force official recognition of the Turkish-Cypriot entity by the south -- and that President Glafcos Clerides withdraw the Cypriot EU membership application.	PREV
Ankara welcomed "relative progress" in Turkish-EU ties made at this week's European summit at Cardiff, Wales, but stopped short of calling for a resumption of political dialogue.	CIRC
Britain, which holds the EU presidency, hailed the Cardiff meeting as a positive step toward rapprochement with Ankara, saying that Turkey's membership candidacy was clearly acknowledged.	VERB
But a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement criticized the Cardiff meeting for reiterating what Ankara considers to be unacceptable EU conditions for Turkey's membership to advance.	VERB
Those conditions are that Turkey improves its human rights record and makes progress on solving its disputes with Greece, including Aegean territorial disputes as well as the tension over Cyprus.	VERB
Ankara is also seeking the release of EU financial aid for Ankara called for under a 1996 customs union agreement but which has been held up by Greece.	MAIN
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitas said he rebuffed a telephone appeal from President Clinton during the Cardiff summit to soften the Greek stance toward Turkey.	VERB
I told President Clinton that this was not possible," he said.	VERB
The United States, concerned that the EU snub could drive Turkey away from the West and increase the risk of conflict in the Aegean, has stepped up diplomatic efforts aimed at improving Turkish-EU relations.	CONS
Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton administration's special envoy to Cyprus and newly nominated ambassador to the United Nations, will visit Athens on Monday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington today.	CONS

The American Medical Association voted yesterday to install the heir apparent as its president-elect, rejecting a strong, upstart challenge by a District doctor who argued that the nation's largest physicians' group needs stronger ethics and new leadership.	LEAD
In electing Thomas R. Reardon, an Oregon general practitioner who had been the chairman of its board, members signified they did not hold him responsible for a costly gaffe last year, when the group agreed to endorse a line of Sunbeam Corp. health care products.	CIRC
Reardon had become chairman just before the signing of the Sunbeam deal, which would have funneled millions of dollars to the AMA but violated its prohibition against letting its name be used for commercial purposes.	CIRC
Throughout the year and at the association's annual meeting in Chicago this week, the episode heightened dissent within the organization, the largest-spending lobbying group in the country, which already has been weakened by a substantial decline in membership and the medical profession's diminished clout in an era of managed care.	CONS
Reardon said yesterday that his election is evidence that physicians are eager to put last year's troubles behind them.	VERB
In an interview, Reardon said he plans to focus on trying to persuade Congress to enact legislation to give doctors and patients more power against health maintenance organizations and other types of managed care.	VERB
He said the AMA also will emphasize a patient-safety initiative, an effort to teach doctors to provide better help to dying patients and their families, and an attempt to make sure the federal government does not punish doctors for simple billing mistakes in its efforts to crack down on Medicare fraud.	VERB
Reardon said he will work to rebuild AMA membership, which has slipped to the point that less than 40 percent of the nation's doctors now belong.	VERB
But Raymond Scalettar, the Washington rheumatologist who announced that he would oppose Reardon just two weeks ago, said yesterday's 270 to 196 vote reflects a reservoir of discontent within the organization.	VERB
It is clearly a message . . . that the leadership of the American Medical Association has to be really on its toes for the future," said Scalettar, who was the AMA's board chairman five years ago.	VERB
Scalettar's candidacy marked the first time in 25 years that someone decided at the last minute to mount an insurgent challenge to what usually is a well-choreographed succession to the presidency of the 295,000-member organization.	MAIN
Reardon now becomes the president-elect, and will begin a one-year term as president next year.	MAIN
Yesterday, Nancy Dickey of Texas became the AMA's first female president.	MAIN
Many doctors at this week's meetings said they think the organization needs to move beyond the recent controversy.	VERB
The physicians back home aren't interested in Sunbeam," said Robert Weierman, an orthopedic surgeon from South Orange, N.J., who is one of the AMA's 495 voting delegates.	VERB
Reimbursement problems and the slowdown in payments are the main issues where I come from.	VERB
But others said the Sunbeam matter will continue to haunt the association, particularly since the corporation has sued the AMA for $ 20 million.	VERB
The financial cost to the AMA is the least of it," one physician said at a forum on the matter.	VERB
The real cost is loss of prestige, the embarrassment we had, the realization our ship was not on course.'	VERB

Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to buy WJLA (Channel 7) in Washington and seven other TV stations across the country owned by broadcasting and banking magnate Joe L. Allbritton, sources said yesterday.	LEAD
If the negotiations are successful, Disney-owned ABC would take over management of WJLA, the local ABC affiliate, and establish it as the Washington base for the network, which already owns stations in 10 other major cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.	CONS
Allbritton Communications' stations could fetch $ 750 million to $ 900 million, according to rough valuations by industry sources.	CONS
Yeah, we're interested," said an ABC executive who did not want to be identified.	VERB
The executive said ABC does not publicly discuss possible acquisitions.	VERB
Disney, like other broadcasting networks, is eager to buy local stations, which are the most profitable part of the television business.	EVAL
The ABC network is ailing and anticipates losses this year, though such losses are more than offset by strong profits of the local stations ABC owns and operates.	EVAL
Allbritton's TV empire is attractive because it is one of the few remaining groups of ABC affiliates that Disney could purchase.	EVAL
Federal deregulation of the broadcasting business in 1996 raised limits on the number of stations that a single company can own.	HIST
It set off a buying frenzy, which has driven the price of television stations to record levels.	HIST
Allbritton, 72, owns Allbritton Communications Corp. and has a controlling interest in Riggs National Corp. of Washington, the parent company of Riggs Bank.	CIRC
He has been approached repeatedly about selling the bank, but has rejected the offers.	CIRC
Price could be the crucial factor in negotiations for the television stations.	EVAL
Both Disney and Allbritton are known as hard bargainers.	EVAL
Allbritton and his son, Robert, 28, chief operating officer of Allbritton Communications, were in London yesterday for the annual shareholders meeting of Riggs AP Bank, a British affiliate of Riggs National Bank, and could not be reached for comment.	CIRC
Jerald Fritz, general counsel of Allbritton Communications, said the company does not comment on rumors or media reports.	VERB
Through a separate company, Allbritton also owns Newschannel 8, the Washington all-news cable channel.	VERB
Industry sources said Newschannel 8, a six-year-old local station that has yet to turn a profit, is included in the package Disney is negotiating to buy.	VERB
Allbritton Communications owns six other ABC affiliates, in Lynchburg, Va.; Tulsa, Okla.;	CIRC
Harrisburg, Pa.; Charleston, S.C.; Tuscaloosa, Ala.; and Little Rock.	CIRC
It owns a low-power station in Alabama and manages another station that serves the Tuscaloosa-Birmingham market.	CIRC
WJLA -- which stands for Joe L. Allbritton -- is the big prize in Allbritton's empire, accounting for half the $ 173 million in revenue the company reported last year.	PREV
The stations generated almost $ 62.8 million in operating cash flow last year, and reported a loss of $ 3 million for the six months ended March 31.	PREV
Industry analysts say cash flow is a better measure of a TV station's performance than profits and is the factor used to determine prices.	EVAL
Stations recently have been selling for 12 to 15 times annual cash flow, which would place the value of Allbritton Communications' stations in the $ 750 million to $ 900 million range.	EVAL
Washington has been a relatively poor market for ABC, primarily because WJLA's lagging local newscast has had poor ratings, which have translated into smaller audiences and advertising rates for the network's shows.	CIRC
ABC counts on local news as a "lead-in" for its "World News	CIRC
Tonight	CIRC
With Peter Jennings" and other programming.	CIRC
WJLA's 5 p.m. newscast, anchored by Paul Berry and Kathleen Mathews, finished third in the ratings during the May "sweeps," despite being preceded by Oprah Winfrey's hugely popular talk show.	PREV
Its 6 p.m. news also ranked third, behind WRC (Channel 4) and WUSA (Channel 9), and was tied for second at 11 p.m. with WUSA, although both were a distant second to WRC at that hour.	PREV
If it purchases the station, ABC would likely beef up WJLA's local news operation to bolster ratings for the network news.	EXPE
ABC owns stations in 10 cities, covering about 25 percent of the nation's population, leaving it well below the federal ownership limit of 35 percent of the population.	CIRC

More than 1,000 people, including a few aging resistance fighters, gathered at the University of East Timor today in this Indonesian-occupied territory for a demonstration that was more remarkable for what did not happen.	LEAD
Unlike in the past, when Indonesia was ruled by former president Suharto, security forces, for the second time this week, did not harass protesters.	MAIN
Soldiers were nowhere to be seen around the campus as the demonstrators spoke over loudspeakers about their desire for independence.	MAIN
"Viva!	MAIN
" they shouted, punching their fists into the air.	MAIN
They gathered on the back lawn of the campus and some sat on the school's roof, unfurling banners calling for the release of jailed resistance leader Jose Alexandre 'Xanana' Gusmao, or proclaiming "Death or independence!	MAIN
This is a golden chance for us," said Jovensio Martinez, 37, who spent nearly seven years in prison after a 1991 street demonstration during which security forces shot and killed at least 50 protesters.	VERB
It's the first chance we get to express our feelings on how to solve our problems and decide our political future," he said.	VERB
We have been crushed down for 23 years.	VERB
Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year.	PREV
The United Nations still recognizes Portugal, East Timor's former colonial ruler, as the territory's administrative authority.	PREV
In an interview today with the Japanese news service Kyodo, President B.J. Habibie rejected independence for East Timor.	VERB
The integration of East Timor was accomplished more than 20 years ago with the will of the people themselves, and there is no going back now," he said.	VERB
He had previously suggested granting the territory "special status" but the Timorese rejected the idea.	CIRC
The students and most of the general population want a referendum to determine the region's future.	CIRC
Student protests ushered the fall of Suharto, who stepped down last month after 32 years in power, but that was not until at least four student demonstrators were slain by security forces.	CIRC
Massive rioting followed, prompting some of Suharto's key allies, including members of the military, to abandon him.	CIRC
But it is the military here that wields control, enjoying a certain amount of autonomy from the Indonesian government.	EVAL
The governor and local military commanders have already warned against demonstrations.	PREV
Soldiers have refrained from trying to prevent campus protests here, but they broke up a demonstration Friday by East Timorese at the Foreign Ministry in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.	PREV
It is unclear whether the military is taking a softer line in light of the new political reform era in Indonesia, or is just trying to sort itself out after Suharto's fall and the deaths of 12 senior regional military commanders in a helicopter crash this month.	EVAL
The United States suspended most of its military assistance to Indonesia after the 1991 killings in Dili, but nonetheless East Timor hardly registers on the agenda in Jakarta unless foreign governments bring up the issue.	PREV
The climate of fear in East Timor goes much deeper than in Indonesia.	EVAL
Nearly every other adult in Dili has been detained or tortured, or knows someone who has been, during the past 23 years of Indonesian rule.	EVAL
Reports from Lisbon said that authorities today detained prominent activist M'a Huno, who had been a commander of separatist forces.	CIRC

I have hope when I see these young people now," he said.	VERB
When I see them struggling, it gives meaning to my struggle before.	VERB
I'm already old, but my dream would be fulfilled to see the new generation liberated from the oppressors.	VERB
Analysts say the next few weeks should indicate how far the student movement in East Timor will go, but it appears from today's demonstration that it is unlikely the protesters will try to march in the streets or take over parliament, as students tried to do in Jakarta.	EXPE
Panic almost erupted during today's protest when a truck of soldiers merely drove by.	MAIN
The demonstration was held far out of sight of the main road to lessen the chances of a confrontation.	MAIN

AT&T Corp. formally announced its $ 48 billion takeover of cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. yesterday, vowing to become the one-stop provider of a dazzling array of telecommunications services to households across the country.	MAIN
The immediate winner in the deal was TCI's chairman, John C. Malone, who will receive AT&T stock worth an estimated $ 15 billion for stock he personally owns or votes in trust for TCI's late founder, Bob Magness.	CONS
TCI's other public shareholders will receive AT&T stock worth almost $ 51 per share, a premium of nearly 32 percent over TCI's Class A stock closing price on Tuesday, and nearly five times the value of the shares only 20 months ago.	CONS
Malone and AT&T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong promised yesterday that millions of residential customers will ultimately benefit from the companies' marriage, too.	MAIN
By coupling TCI's cable connections with its own long-distance lines and familiar brand name, AT&T said it will someday be able to offer the first major competition to the regional Bell phone companies, which now hold a near-monopoly on local phone service.	MAIN
What's more, AT&T envisions a day when customers can obtain, via a single monthly bill, all of the major telecommunications services: long-distance, cellular and local phone service, high-speed Internet links, as well as pay-per-view movies, ESPN's game of the week, and new types of electronic shopping.	CONS
Said Malone at a news conference in New York: "If you want to order an extra phone line, all you'll have to do is point and click. . . .	VERB
If you're watching an entertainment program and want to order Viagra, all you'll have to do is point and click.	VERB
He added: "We're going to make it easy to use . . .	VERB
[and] packaged in a way so that the consumer gets a terrific deal.	VERB
Combined, the companies will have an impressive reach.	EVAL
AT&T now serves about half of all residential long-distance customers, although AT&T must rely on local phone firms such as Bell Atlantic Corp. to get to those customers' homes.	CIRC
TCI, meanwhile, serves about 10.5 million cable households.	CIRC
But its wires pass by a total of 17 million households.	CIRC
It also partially owns companies, such as Cablevision Systems Corp. of New York, whose wires pass by another 16 million households -- giving AT&T potential direct access to as much as one-third of all the nation's households.	CIRC
ATT is hoping regulators will view the deal as a spur to stalled local phone competition.	EXPE
Analysts said, however, that it could give the regional Bells -- which were spun off from AT&T in 1984 -- a potent argument that they should now be allowed into the long-distance business.	EXPE
And AT&T will still need the cooperation of its local phone rivals to serve the two-thirds of the country	EXPE
TCI's cable won't reach.	EXPE
The creation of the "one-wire world" that Malone and Armstrong described yesterday is likely to require billions of dollars of additional investment for AT&T and could take years to complete, analysts and AT&T's competitors say.	EXPE
Investor worries about this drain on future earnings drove down AT&T stock, the most widely held in the country, which fell $ 5.37 1/2 yesterday to close at $ 60 on the New York Stock Exchange.	CONS
TCI's Class A shares, in contrast, rose $ 1.06, to $ 39.75, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.	CONS
Forecasting the telecommunications future has proven notoriously frustrating.	EVAL
Malone himself told an industry conference in 1992 that cable customers would soon have 500 channels as well as interactive services, such as home shopping, and phone calls via cable lines.	PREV
These improvements have failed to materialize.	PREV
Phone companies also made their own unfulfilled promises about the "convergence" of telecommunications services.	PREV
Bell Atlantic -- whose deal to buy TCI foundered in 1993 -- launched two unsuccessful experiments in delivering TV shows, one over copper phone lines and another over so-called "wireless" digital relay stations.	PREV
For its part, AT&T last year abandoned an effort to market DirecTV's satellite TV service through its long-distance operations.	PREV
(AT&T officials said yesterday selling cable service, which is more familiar to consumers, should be easier.)	PREV
It also made an expensive -- and largely unsuccessful -- foray into the computer business in 1991, when it bought NCR Corp. for $ 7.4 billion.	PREV
Both Armstrong and Malone vowed yesterday that this time will be different.	VERB
They said AT&T would be able to offer phone service over some of TCI's cable systems within 18 months.	VERB
Upgrades of TCI's network that will enable consumers to receive two-way services, such as lightning-fast connections to the Internet, will be complete by the end of the year 2000, they added.	VERB
But some doubt those timetables.	VERB
It's going to be a while before these things are generally available," said William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint Corp., one of AT&T's main long-distance rivals and a company that once considered a cable-phone partnership with TCI and two other major cable companies.	VERB
TCI's [network] is not in great shape," though its cable systems have improved, Esrey said.	VERB
It's not that the cable plant can't be made more reliable.	VERB
It'll just take time.	VERB
When TCI's wires do become capable of offering local phone service, AT&T may be required to lease some of their capacity to competitors, under terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.	EXPE
Steve Case, chief executive of America Online Inc., the Dulles-based online service, noted that possibility yesterday, saying in a statement: "We look forward to entering into a broadband reseller agreement with AT&T once the merger with TCI is complete, and we look forward to entering similar agreements with other cable companies as they, too, embrace a truly 'open cable' approach.	VERB
In light of all this, Sprint's Esrey questioned whether AT&T was paying too much for TCI.	MAIN
In addition to the $ 31.8 billion in stock it will pay for TCI's Class A and B shares, AT&T will take on TCI's $ 11 billion in debt, plus lay out $ 5.5 billion more to buy back TCI's interest in Teleport Communications Group Inc. and At Home Corp.	MAIN
All told, AT&T reckoned the value of the deal is $ 48 billion -- or a little less than twice the annual revenue for the entire cable industry.	MAIN
The buyout of TCI will apparently mean a greatly reduced role for Malone, perhaps the most powerful man in the cable industry and its best-known figure after Time Warner Inc. Vice Chairman Ted Turner.	CONS
Although Malone will be a major AT&T shareholder and a member of the AT&T board, his main job will be running Liberty Media Corp., a spinoff from TCI that holds its minority investments in such cable networks as Discovery and Black Entertainment Television.	CONS
Said a longtime Malone colleague, "It looks to me like John has found his exit strategy.	VERB
D.C. residents may be among the beneficiaries of AT&T's plan to upgrade services, since TCI controls the local cable provider, District Cablevision.	EXPE
But Robert L. Johnson, who is chairman of the partnership that owns a portion of the D.C. system, said yesterday that it might be a candidate for sale because it doesn't fit easily into TCI's cluster of systems in other metropolitan areas.	CONS

The competition continues through Sunday at the Mayling Club de Campo, 40 miles (60 kms) north of Buenos Aires.	CONS
Lucas Arnold and Luris Lobo, both of Argentina, will face Miguel Tobon and Philippe Moggio in doubles play on Saturday.	CONS

Italian defender Christian Panucci ruled out reports Friday that he planned to leave Real Madrid and rejoin Fabio Capello's AC Milan, saying he intended to finish his six-season contract with the Spanish club.	MAIN
``I wouldn't go to Milan for a billion,''	VERB
Panucci, sitting alongside Madrid chairman Lorenzo Sanz, told a press conference.	VERB
``I am very happy here.''	VERB
A former Milan star, Panucci signed for Real Madrid half-way through last season while Capello was coach of the Spanish side and led it to win the league championship.	CIRC
He is under contract until 2003.	CIRC
Sanz said that anyone who wanted to buy Panucci before that would have to pay the 15 billion pesetas (dlrs 100 million) stipulated.	VERB
Talk that Panucci might follow Capello back home increased in recent weeks with poor performances leading him to be frequently placed on the substitutes' bench by current Madrid coach Juup Heynckes.	CIRC

MOSCOW (AP)	LEAD
Two Russians and a Frenchman left the Mir and endured a rough landing on the snow-covered plains of Central Asia on Thursday.	LEAD
But no one was hurt as the crew completed a successful mission on the 12th anniversary of the space station's launch.	LEAD
Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov and French astronaut Leopold Eyharts were briefly buffeted about in their Soyuz space capsule when they touched down in the empty steppe of central Kazakstan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing Mission Control officials.	MAIN
It took the crew three hours to descend from the Mir, 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth.	MAIN
Space officials were worried beforehand about a blizzard that raged through former Soviet republic on Wednesday evening and early Thursday.	CIRC
They considered delaying the crew's return, but gave the go-ahead when the weather improved.	CIRC
``Guys, don't you worry, the weather is getting better,'' Mission Control Chief Vladimir Solovyov told the crew.	VERB
Still, strong winds at the landing site dragged the tiny landing capsule across the steppe as it touched down.	MAIN
Deep snow helped cushion the impact, ITAR-Tass reported.	MAIN
Immediately after the landing, the trio was put on a flight to Moscow for routine medical checkups.	CONS
The two Russians arrived on the Mir last August when the troubled space station was hobbled by a number of breakdowns, including a reduced power supply.	PREV
But Solovyov and Vinogradov performed several successful repair missions.	PREV
The station is now back at close to full power and has not had any major problems in recent months.	PREV
Solovyov, one of the most experienced space flyers ever, celebrated his 50th birthday during his six-month space voyage.	PREV
He completed his fifth mission on the Mir and has now spent more than 20 months in space.	PREV
This was Vinogradov's first stint on the Mir, while Eyharts was aboard for the past three weeks conducting scientific experiments.	CIRC
The Mir was launched on Feb. 19, 1986, and was expected to remain in operation for only five years.	HIST
A series of near disasters last year, including a fire, computer breakdowns, and a collision with a cargo ship, raised doubts about the Mir's safety.	HIST
But Russian space officials want to keep the spacecraft manned at least until next year, when an new international space station is put aloft.	EXPE
Russians Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin and American Andrew Thomas remain aboard the Mir.	CIRC

RAINY PASS, Alaska (AP)	LEAD
Five-time champion Rick Swenson wasted no time moving to the front of the pack in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.	LEAD
Swenson on Monday was the first musher to reach the Rainy Pass checkpoint, which is tucked deep in the Alaska Range.	MAIN
He arrived 90 minutes ahead of his nearest competitor, Charlie Boulding of Manley, Alaska.	MAIN
Vern Halter of Willow arrived just four minutes after Boulding.	MAIN
With clear skies, the dog teams rested on beds of straw on frozen Puntilla Lake, surrounded by spectacular views of craggy, snow-covered peaks.	CIRC
Mitch Seavey of Sterling arrived in fourth place, two-time champion Jeff King reached the checkpoint in fifth place.	CIRC
Mike Nosko of Wasilla arrived at in sixth place and rookie Shawn Sidelinger of Wasilla was in seventh.	CIRC
Mushers were pleased with snow conditions on the trail.	CIRC
``I can't imagine anyone complaining about the trail,'' said musher Linwood Fiedler of Willow, who was first to leave the Finger Lake checkpoint for the to Rainy Pass.	VERB
``It was a sprint trail as far as I was concerned.''	VERB
Sixty-three teams _ including four past champions _ are entered in this year's race, as well as 19 rookies and mushers from five foreign countries.	CIRC
Swenson added interest to the 26th Iditarod by reentering after being withdrawn in 1996 when a dog in his team died along the trail.	HIST
Swenson, who has never finished lower than 10th in 20 Iditarods, bitterly protested, and the decision was overturned last year.	HIST
But he sat out 1997 anyway.	HIST
Swenson has said he's running in part to honor his dog Ariel, who died of apparent strangulation in 1996.	VERB
``I'm as confident as anyone,''	VERB

DAVOS,	LEAD
Switzerland _	LEAD
Asia's economic meltdown has spurred all sorts of would-be geo-architects to try to design some new, global mechanism that will regulate international capital flows and miraculously prevent global investors and speculators from ever again wreaking havoc.	LEAD
I am deeply skeptical about such ideas _ not because I oppose tempering market excesses, but because I think that trying to do it on a global scale is nearly impossible.	EVAL
Risk, fear, greed and excess are intrinsic to markets.	EVAL
You cannot legislate them out without paying a huge price.	EVAL
What's interesting is that while Westerners are trying to redesign the market, the Thais, Koreans and Mexicans at this year's Davos World Economic Forum were focused on redesigning themselves.	CIRC
They think their solution is better local government, not global government.	MAIN
Their countries were like 50-watt bulbs plugged into 250-watt sockets, and when the surge came from the electronic herd of global investors, they blew up.	MAIN
Their reaction is to try to protect themselves with better governance, better regulation and more transparency at home.	MAIN
Which is why both Thailand and Korea elected the most democratic parties in their countries at the depths of this economic crisis.	MAIN
``There are some voices saying that perhaps integration has gone too far and too quickly _ especially in financial markets,'' Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, told me.	VERB
``Well, I happen to believe just the opposite.	VERB
Globalization poses challenges, but it offers tremendous opportunities.	VERB
The fact that finance capital can move instantaneously indeed poses a risk, but jumping from that to say that we need to control movements of capital is totally wrong.''	VERB
Yes, added Zedillo, we need a strong IMF to help in emergencies and to detect distortions in countries or individual banks.	VERB
But at the end of the day, he said, ``all of these financial flows end up in a local financial system, or as resources to be lent by local banks.	VERB
What we have to look at is whether these (local) financial systems are sufficiently installing good banking and financial practices.'	VERB
The Thai prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, told me: ``If you are going to be part of this global market you had better be able to defend yourself from this market ...	VERB
One of the lessons this crisis has taught us is that many of our structures and institutions were not ready for this new era.	VERB
Now we have to adapt ourselves to meet international standards.	VERB
The whole of society expects it.	VERB
They are looking for better government and transparent government.'	VERB
You Jong-keun, the chief economic policy adviser to South Korea's newly elected president, said: ``In the past, the Korean government used its political muscle to emasculate the rights of shareholders, and business leaders were given power to make irresponsible business decisions.	VERB
We are going to strengthen the rights of shareholders and help make sure that business decisions are taken in an accountable fashion.'	VERB
As Bob Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, put it: ``If your domestic institutions are strong, then you don't need very strong global institutions.	VERB
If domestic institutions inside countries are weak, it won't matter how strong your global institutions are.	VERB
They will not be effective.''	VERB
Democracy does not guarantee that you will never have an economic crisis.	EVAL
We know that.	EVAL
Markets overshoot.	EVAL
Investors take crazy risks.	EVAL
But the more democratic, accountable and open your governance, especially as an emerging market, the less likely it is that your financial system will be exposed to surprises,	EVAL
the easier it will be for you to improve and adapt when it is, and the more legitimacy your government will have to share the pain when change is required.	EVAL
Of those Asian nations who were fully plugged into the market (China is not), those with the most non-corrupt, transparent and accountable financial systems _ Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore _ have been hurt the least.	EVAL
Those that had democratic, but corrupt, systems _ Thailand and Korea _ were hurt the second worst, but at least have been able to respond quickly by voting in better governance.	EVAL
And the country that is going to melt down is Indonesia, which remains plugged into the electronic herd, but its corrupt, authoritarian regime can't adapt.	EVAL
``Look around the neighborhood,'' said the Thai finance minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda.	VERB
``Good governance is the only real protection.''	VERB

YAMANOUCHI, Japan _ ``ROSS IS THE CHAMPION.	VERB
GIVE THE GOLD BACK!'	VERB
The words were written in black marker on a linen hotel napkin, and the young man holding that napkin up i the drizzle at the bottom of the snowboarding halfpipe run this morning was the Canadian rider Michael Michalchuck.	MAIN
``I made it last night because I believe in Ross,'' said Michalchuck, 20, from Calgary.	VERB
Ross Rebagliati, the Canadian snowboarder who has been stripped of his gold medal in the giant slalom by the International Olympic Committee after testing positive for marijuana, was not one of the spectators Thursday at the Kanbayashi Snowboard Park.	CIRC
But he was unquestionably the central figure as the men's and women's halfpipe riders made their Olympic debuts.	CIRC
``Ross won fair and square; he is the gold medalist, and no one can deny him that,'' Michalchuck said.	VERB
``I don't understand why this is happening.	VERB
He is a friend of mine, and he should be given the gold back.	VERB
I saw him before this, and he was on top of the world.	VERB
This should never have happened to him.'	VERB
Michalchuck decided to make his very public appeal on Wednesday night, and when he finished his opening run, he unstrapped his board, took the napkin from his girlfriend and calmly held it up to the photographers and television camera operators waiting in the finish area.	MAIN
``I think the Olympics are good for snowboarding, but I don't think this whole deal is,'' he said.	VERB
``Marijuana is not a performance-enhancing drug, and Ross did not smoke it; he was just subjected to it,'' he added.	VERB
``Marijuana is present in every sport.	VERB
If it happens to be more present in snowboarding, it may be just because it's a younger generation.	VERB
A lot of us do not smoke it, but I'm not denying that a lot of my friends do.	VERB
You're not going to change a friend because they do.''	VERB
Michalchuck was not the only Canadian to take an activist stance.	VERB
``In the spirit of snowboarders, we're not going to sit down on this,'' said Mark Fawcett, one of Rebagliati's fellow giant- slalom riders.	VERB
``We're going to try to take the scar and put it back on the IOC.	VERB
To come right back at them.'	VERB
Cara-Beth Burnside of the United States said: ``Everyone was furious.	VERB
Everyone was, like, Ross won the gold, no matter what.	VERB
It wasn't anything that was affecting his performance.	VERB
I mean, come on, they're kicking people out for cough medicine.'	VERB
Others were more circumspect.	VERB
``Well, marijuana is on the list,'' said Norwegian Anne Molin Kongsgaard, who added that the disqualification was ``very sad.'	VERB
Some riders also expressed dismay that after waiting for years to show their moves in the Olympics, this issue was now much more interesting to the world than whether they had just performed a McTwist.	VERB
``It's a weird day,'' said the Canadian team spokesman, Paul Rivard. ``Because the riders know everybody wants to talk about something other than their run, and they want to stay focused.'	VERB
